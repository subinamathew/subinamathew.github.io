      <description>Here are some explainable AI features that can help to understand why an AI came to a decision. This post will be contantly updated. Keep coming back for more!
  Advanced AI explainability for PyTorch: https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam
This project helps us understand how the AI calculates based on visual cues. This is really good to understand the AI. Project is MIT licensed.

      <description>The State of AI Report seeks to trigger informed conversation about the state of AI and its implication for the future. Here is a link to the latest updates on AI.
SOURCE: https://www.stateof.ai/
Key themes in the 2022 Report include:
New independent research labs are rapidly open sourcing the closed source output of major labs. Despite the dogma that AI research would be increasingly centralised among a few large players, the lowered cost of and access to compute has led to state-of-the-art research coming out of much smaller, previously unknown labs.</description>
