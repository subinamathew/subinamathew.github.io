      <description>Here are some explainable AI features that can help to understand why an AI came to a decision. This post will be contantly updated. Keep coming back for more!
  Advanced AI explainability for PyTorch: https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam
This project helps us understand how the AI calculates based on visual cues. This is really good to understand the AI. Project is MIT licensed.

      <description>Prof. Richard Buggs an evolutionary biologist and molecular ecologist talks about how Darwinian tree of life may be wrong and insists that we need to look deeper into the fact that we cannot explain everything with evolutionary biology and may be it is time that we take another look at the Biblical view of a designer.

      <description>Gitpod is a free, open-source, cloud-based development environment. Gitpod allows you to work on your own projects in your browser, without the need to install any software. It helps you to develop, test and share your code with your team.
Gitpod Main URL: https://gitpod.io
Gitpod Workspace URL: https://gitpod.io/workspaces
  In this page, I will be constantly updating exampes of Gitpod.
Here are the examples in a GitLab Project.

      <description>The State of AI Report seeks to trigger informed conversation about the state of AI and its implication for the future. Here is a link to the latest updates on AI.
SOURCE: https://www.stateof.ai/
Key themes in the 2022 Report include:
New independent research labs are rapidly open sourcing the closed source output of major labs. Despite the dogma that AI research would be increasingly centralised among a few large players, the lowered cost of and access to compute has led to state-of-the-art research coming out of much smaller, previously unknown labs.</description>
